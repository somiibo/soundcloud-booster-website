Our {{ breadcrumb }} is designed to provide transparency into our services and products, in a format that our users can easily navigate, read, and understand. We are dedicated to providing a fair and high-quality service to you.

"Subscriber" is used to describe a user of a {{ brand }} Product who pays a fee to obtain enhanced features of that {{ brand }} Product. More information about subscriptions can be found on our [pricing page]({{ site.url }}/pricing).

## Payments, Subscriptions, and Cancellation Policy
You need a subscription to use certain features of {{ brand }} Products. If you apply for a subscription, you must ensure all the information you submit is true and accurate (including, without limitation, your credit/debit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent if you are under 18 years of age. You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply, including all applicable taxes.

By submitting your order, you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant part of the {{ brand }} Product(s). Your offer is accepted, and a binding contract occurs when: (i) we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received, or (ii) you log into or use a subscribers-only part of a {{ brand }} Product (whichever comes first).

ALL SUBSCRIPTION PAYMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE TAKEN IN ADVANCE AT THE RELEVANT INTERVALS (E.G., MONTHLY IN THE CASE OF MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTIONS) UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.

Payments by credit/debit cards are subject to our credit card agreement, which forms part of these terms and conditions.

We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time, with or without notice.

We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties. We reserve the right to terminate your account without the possibility of a refund if we find that you are violating any portion of this contract.

<!-- You may cancel your subscription at any time by visiting [{{ site.url }}/account]({{ site.url }}/account) and manually canceling your subscription. Any other method of cancellation, including email, phone, or other means, will not be accepted unless otherwise stated or required by law.

Upon cancellation, you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made in respect of subscriptions will be refunded (wholly or partly).

### Sales & Refund Policy
All sales are final. If you experience issues, please contact {{ brand }}.

If you request a refund, we will determine the eligibility of your refund. Upon approval, you will be refunded by the same method of payment you originally used. -->

### Free Trial Period Eligibility
The availability and duration of the free trial period are subject to change and may not be available at all times. The current trial and pricing information is available on our [pricing page]({{ site.url }}/pricing).

If you have not previously benefited from a free trial of our service, you may be eligible to receive a trial period at no cost.

During the trial period, you will be charged $0.00, although a small authorization charge (typically $1) may be applied to verify your payment method. This authorization charge will be refunded within 3-5 business days.

### Payment Following Trial
Upon the conclusion of the trial period, you will automatically be charged the applicable subscription fee unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period.

You will not receive a notice from us that your trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun.

### Cancellation and Refund
You are eligible for a full refund of the subscription fee if you cancel your subscription within the free trial period. Cancelling your subscription after the trial period or failure to cancel within the trial period will result in the forfeiture of your eligibility for a refund.

If your subscription plan did not include a free trial period, you are not eligible for a refund on your subscription fee.

You may cancel your subscription at any time by visiting [{{ site.url }}/account]({{ site.url }}/account) and navigating to the Billing section of your account. Any other method of cancellation including email, phone, or other means will not be accepted unless otherwise stated or required by law.

Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made in respect of subscriptions will be refunded (wholly or partly).

Any other purchases, including one-time payments, add-ons, or other sales on our site that do not include a free trial period are final and non-refundable once processed.

Should you request a refund, we will determine the eligibility of your refund. If approved, you will be refunded via the same payment method you originally used. Requests can be made using our [refund request form](https://itwcreativeworks.com/portal/account/payment/refund).

# ðŸš€ Getting started
Before getting started, be sure you are using **Node.js** `v10` (higher versions may not work).
1. [Create a repo](https://github.com/itw-creative-works/ultimate-jekyll/generate) from the **Ultimate Jekyll** template.
2. Rename the `template` branch to `master`.
3. In the repo's settings add a secret called `GH_TOKEN` and paste a GitHub token that has write permissions for this repo.
4. Clone the repo to your local machine with the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/).
5. Run `npm run template:setup` in Terminal to setup the template.
6. Run `npm start` in Terminal to launch the website locally.

# ðŸ“¦ How to sync with the template

# ðŸŒŽ Publishing your website
1. Change the `url` in `_config.yml` to your domain.
2. Push your changes to GitHub using `npm run dist` in Terminal.

# ðŸ’ˆ How to properly use the template
This repo will only ever receive changes to files located in `master` folders. You can safely customize any file in `app` folders. For example:
  * You should **NOT** edit: `assets/_src/js/master/main.js`
  * You should edit: `assets/_src/js/app/app.js`
You can always run `npm run template:update` to get all the latest updates from the **Ultimate Jekyll template** but be sure to check if there were any breaking changes.

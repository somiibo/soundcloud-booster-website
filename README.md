# Creating & synching new repo from the ultimate-jekyll template
1. Navigate to [https://github.com/itw-creative-works/ultimate-jekyll/](https://github.com/itw-creative-works/ultimate-jekyll/) and click **Use this template** or just [generate it here](https://github.com/iwiedenm/ultimate-jekyll/generate).
2. In the next window, name the new repository and choose an organization to host the repository.
3. Click **1 Branch** in the middle bar and then the pencil icon next to `template` in the next window. Name it `master`.
4. Open the newly created repository on GitHub and click **Open in Desktop** then choose location using GitHub desktop.
5. In the repo's settings add a secret called `ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste a GitHub token that has write permissions for this repo.
6. Open Terminal and do the following commands or simply `npm run template:setup`    
7. Go back into GitHub desktop on the new repo and press **Push** in top bar.
8. Initialize the new repo by entering this command in Terminal:
  * `npm start`

# Get changes from the ultimate-jekyll template
Perform the following steps or simply run `npm run template:update`
1. Open GitHub Desktop and select your project (not ultimate-jekyll, the project that uses ultimate-jekyll).
2. Change current branch to `template`.
3. Then press **Fetch upstream**.
4. Then **Pull upstream**.
5. Change current branch to `master`.
6. Click **Choose branch to merge into `master`** from the branch dropdown (at the bottom).
7. Select `template` from the list.
8. Click the blue **Merge `template` into `master`** button.
9. Press **Push origin** in the top right.

# How to properly use the template
This repo will only ever receive changes to files located in `master` folders. You can safely customize any file in `app` folders. For example:
  * Do **NOT** edit: `assets/_src/js/master/main.js`
  * Do edit: `assets/_src/js/app/app.js`
You can always run `npm run template:update` to get all the latest updates from the **Ultimate Jekyll template** but be sure to check if there were any breaking changes.

# Run a local https server
1. Execute:
  * `npm run create:cert`
  * `npm run prototype:https`
2. Press <kbd>cmd + option + i</kbd> on the webpage that opens.
3. Go to **Security** tab and press **Show certificate**.
4. Drag the certificate to your Desktop then double-click it
5. Double-click it when it has opened in keychain
6. Open the **trust** dropdown and change it to **always trust**

Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of analytics. Keeping tabs on your metrics is crucial. Use SoundCloud's analytics to monitor which tracks are performing well and which ones need a little TLC. Adjust your strategy based on these insights. For example, if a particular genre or style gets more traction, consider creating more content in that vein. It's all about playing to your strengths.

Collaborations are another golden nugget. Partnering with other artists can exponentially increase your reach. When you collaborate, you tap into each other's audiences, creating a win-win situation. And yes, you can use Somiibo to identify potential collaborators by automating the process of following and messaging artists in your genre.
